This is the Crystals Collector game. 

The game starts when a random value between 19 and 120 is selected by the computer and displayed in the "Your number is" section.

Then, the goal of the player will be clicking the crystals on the screen and adding their values until the total displayed under the "Your total score is" section matches the value selected by the computer.

If the player is able to match the exact same value, then he wins and the game starts over. The amount of wins will be displayed right next to "Wins".

If the player score goes above the value selected by the computer, the player loses and the value displayed under "Losses" increases by 1.
